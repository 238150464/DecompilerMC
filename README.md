# DecompilerMC

---
**What is this for?**

This tool will help you convert mappings from mojang from their proguard format to the tsrg format that then can be used directly with specialsource which will then remap the client jar. Once that done it can be decompiled either with cfr (code only) or fernflower (assets and code).

---

**Important Note **

We support both linux and windows.

You need a java runtime inside your path (Java 8 should be good)

CFR decompilation is approximately 60s and fernflower takes roughly 200s, please give it time

For windows you can run the release file directly (in https://github.com/hube12/DecompilerMC/releases/tag/0.1 ), you can also run it directly with ptyhon 3.5+ with `python main.py`
